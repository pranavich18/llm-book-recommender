# LLM Book Recommender

A lightweight system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide personalized book recommendations. Built in Python with interactive components via Gradio.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine using LLMs and vector search techniques. It supports:  
- Text-based embeddings or vector representations of book descriptions and metadata  
- Similarity searches over book vectors  
- Integration with LLMs to refine or re-rank recommendations  
- A simple web interface for user interaction (via Gradio)

## Repository Structure

- data-exploration.ipynb

- gradio-dashboard.py

- requirements.txt

- sentiment-analysis.ipynb

- text-classification.ipynb

- vector-search.ipynb

- README.md

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pranavich18/llm-book-recommender.git
   cd llm-book-recommender```
   
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\\Scripts\\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Running the Application
Launch the Gradio UI server by executing:

```
python gradio-dashboard.py
```

This will open an interactive web interface where you can input book-related text or preferences, and receive book recommendations generated by the system.

## How It Works

1. Data Processing & Embeddings — Extract book descriptions and metadata, preprocess them, and convert text into embeddings (vector representations).

2. Vector Search / Similarity Matching — Use a vector database to find similar books by distance/similarity to the input embedding.

3. Filtering & Re-ranking — Optionally filter by sentiment, category, or other criteria.

4. User Interface — Provide a responsive UI using Gradio to accept input and display recommendations.

## Notebooks & Analyses

data-exploration.ipynb — initial data exploration and cleaning

vector-search.ipynb — embedding generation and similarity search

text-classification.ipynb — classification, including zero-shot or fine-tuned categories

sentiment-analysis.ipynb — analyzing emotional tone of text

gradio-dashboard.py — start the interface for recommendation

## Contributing & Improvements
Add additional book metadata (e.g. author, genres, user ratings)

Improve ranking and filtering logic

Support larger datasets or paginated loading

Deploy as a cloud service (e.g. Hugging Face Spaces, FastAPI)

Enhance UI (e.g. images, layout, faceted filters)
